# What is taskTurtle?

taskTurtle is a site to connect people who need work done, with people who do work. Are you in need of a handyman? A painter?
A general contractor? Post your job, and the workers will see and bid on those jobs, giving you quality work, and them, 
a paycheck.

# How does it work?

First, start by creating a user account. It'll ask for your name, email address, and phone number. If you're a contractor,
there's a button to click that will flag your account, and open some additional fields for your business name, and 
business contact info.

# What if I need work done?

Once you're logged in, you'll see your profile page, and can start posting up the work you need done. Whether it's something
simple like having a wall painted, to something complex like remodeling your house. We'll ask for a general description of the
work you need to have done, more specific details, and how long you want the project to be available for bidding. Upload a few
photos of the jobsite, or choose an image based on the type of work, and then click Create. It's that easy. Once your job is 
created, it will be available for contractors to view and bid on.

# What if I'm the one who does work?

Once you're logged in, you'll see a display of all the available jobs, with a photo, brief description, the current bid, and 
the time remaining before bidding closes. Click on any job that you're capable of doing to see the details, and decide if it's
a job you want to work on. If it is, click on "Bid Now" and it will ask you to enter your bid amount. Once you've bid, the job
will remain in your profile where you can keep track of the bidding, how much time is remaining, and if you need to enter a
new bid to keep up with your competitors!

# What happens when the bidding closes?

When the bid timer runs out on a job, the creator of the job is notified that the bidding time is up, and the bids are
available to view. The creator of the job will then make the difficult decision of choosing an eager contractor to come out
and do the work that needs to be done. Once a contractor is chosen, they will be notified, and the contact information of 
the job creator will be revealed. It's then time for the job creator, and the contractor to meet to hammer (pun) out the
final details, and get to work.

# Welcome to taskTurtle. Let's get some work done.
